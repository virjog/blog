Shoshin, or beginner's mind, is a Zen Buddhism strategy to keep an open mind when learning. The idea is that when you begin to learn a subject, you have no preconceptions or biases (like a child who does not filter any idea or notion, but rather welcomes all new information with the same openness). As you progress, however, and you learn enough about a subject to be considered an "expert," you lose the natural ability to accept information without filtration. Instead, you actively block and prevent information as it may not fit into the puzzle you created for the subject. 

I was recently exposed to Shoshin again (after initially learning about it years ago from James Clear and Tim Ferriss) from reading Five Minutes on Mondays by Alan Lurie, and I wanted to apply the strategy to blogging. Like many people, I pick up blogging at the beginning of a new year, but fail to continue after writing a few posts. I'm aware of the many benefits blogging provides, however, I have been unable to develop the discipline to continue getting my thoughts down in writing. I hope to change this in 2016 as I approach blogging with the beginner's mind.

By picking up blogging again, I will start by eliminating any preconceptions I have (committing a post every day or week, limiting topics to blog about, having a minimum length for a post, etc.).
