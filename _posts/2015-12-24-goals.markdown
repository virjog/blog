The year is coming to an end. 

Before 2016 ushers in, I wanted to jot down a few important goals to focus on for the upcoming year. 


###1. Create more, consume less
This includes everything from writing to designing to developing. 

###2. Pick up new skills

###3. Secure a summer engineering internship
